# Snake clone for 1st year programming course

Controls:
 * Up Arrow
 * Down Arrow
 * Left Arrow
 * Right Arrow

## Run through a debugger or copy the files from /bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1 to wherever you want

Notes:
 * Hitting the boundaries of the area kills you
 * The game starts immediately and the snake's initial direction is random
 * The game intentionally can spawn you one space away from the boundary
 * After eating the 6th fruit, the game speeds up every 5 fruits until 31 fruits have been eaten
 * Only the top score is stored with no support for names
